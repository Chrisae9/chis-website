## Bootable USBs

My main ISOs are GParted, Memtest, Arch, and Windows 10/11. To do this, I must have a separate USB for each iso. This makes no sense when the primary USB I carry is 128 GB, and the ISOs donâ€™t even fill up a third of the drive.

## Ventoy As A Solution

Using Ventoy, you can use a single USB stick to boot multiple ISOs; here is how to do it on Windows.

### Download the Installer

Format a USB and select it within the program.

## Adding ISOs

Once the formatting is complete, view the USB in the folder Explorer. Create a `boot` folder and drop all ISOs in there.
