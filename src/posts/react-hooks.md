# A Deep Dive into React Hooks

React Hooks have revolutionized how we write React components. Let's explore why they're so powerful.

## useState

The most basic hook, perfect for managing local state in functional components.

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

## useEffect

Handle side effects in your components with ease. `inline`.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
}, [count]);
```
