## Build Notes

- NZXT has always offered high-quality cases for a low price, so I went with the NZXT H210.
- Originally, I was going to buy the i7-9600K because of the high rating on cpu.userbenchmark.com but I managed to get a really good deal on the RAM and CPU at the MicroCenter in Cambridge by buying refurbished parts.
- The Graphics card and SSD were from my old PC but fit perfectly into the purple, black, and white pattern that I was going for.
- The motherboard was the last part I ordered. Since the Z390 ITX was not in-stock anywhere, I was lucky to find this cheap on Amazon refurbished with fast shipping. It arrived on the day I built the PC. There are small scratches on the heat sink but who cares! Thanks to whoever returned that board, you saved me a lot of money.
- I went with a fully modular power supply so that I didnâ€™t have too many wires hanging free in the bottom of the case. I bought from EVGA because I have never had any issues with their products in the past. The 2070 Super that I bought from them off Newegg was refurbished but it came looking brand new.
- I recommend that anyone with a similar build path, try and connect everything to the motherboard before screwing it into the case. It was a PAIN getting all the wires connected with minimal room for fingers.
